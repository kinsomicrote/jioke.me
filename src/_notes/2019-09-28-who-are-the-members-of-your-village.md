title: Who are the members of your village?

During my teenage age, I always had issues with older ones who complained to my mum whenever I misbehaved. She wouldn't side with me when I quizzed about their amebo (gossip) lifestyle. Her excuse was, **it takes a village to raise a child.**

I didn't understand what it meant. For starters, we lived in the city, ***Wetin concern city boy with villagers?***

I was in search of a mentor when I started off learning to code. I always viewed mentorship as a crucial path to greater height in life. As such, I had thought it was important to submit yourself to a mentor. This is popular among Christians, where we have "fathers", and "mothers". A relationship between an elder and a younger person, where the elder serves as a guide to the younger folk, as is evident in the case of Paul and Timothy in the Bible.

I searched for something like to this. So I sent tons and tons of DM on Twitter. I never got a solid, "Yes, I'll be your mentor."

This frustrated me on all levels. The shift started when I came across this tweet.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">How to find a mentor:<br><br>üö´ Don‚Äôt ask them to mentor<br>üí¨ Just ask (specific) questions<br>üìä Apply their insights<br>üî• Follow up w/ results<br>‚ôªÔ∏è Repeat</p>&mdash; Marc K√∂hlbrugge (@marckohlbrugge) <a href="https://twitter.com/marckohlbrugge/status/930120551439437824?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 13, 2017</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

So I started asking questions, and my questions will follow with a list of what I had tried and the results I got. This was better than going in blindfolds, searching for a mentor on a path I was not sure of. I set out first to seek for answers to my questions. Thanks to Google, I always returned with better knowledge than when I started.

I was able to replicate this in other aspects of my life. Instead of seeking for someone's view on a topic without doing my homework. I started by understanding the topic, develop a list of questions and answers, then try to figure out the answer to the question that set me on that path.


As I envolved, it dawned on me that instead of having one individual who I learn from, I could also learn from a collection of people. This has been a primary source of learning for me, alongside reading and other methods I use.

Most of the people I follow on Twitter are folks I learn from, daily. The same applies to my friends.

I've had my share of mentorship, I understand the merits and demerit. My challenge with mentorship is the level of oblivion employed by both parties involved. Young folks entering mentorship without a sense of what they want to get, and older ones accepting to mentor others without knowing what they're accepting. As a result, there is the possibility of genuine advice leading to the demise of the mentee.

Instead of asking, **who is your mentor?** How about we ask, **who are the members of your village?**

We should not fail to know that the fact that an individual is successful in a specific field does not mean such a person will make a good mentor. That mentorship involves teaching. A teacher will take into cognizance the level and the learning ability of the student, and give advice that fits the circumstance surrounding the student. Fully aware that all the variables that made him/her (the mentor) successful won't necessarily make the mentee successful. A teacher will prefer to give a compass as opposed to giving maps.

Even as submit to mentors, we should not fail to learn from an inexhaustible collection of villagers out there, sharing their experience. By learning, I mean consuming and producing. You can start assembling the members of your village, one Twitter profile at a time.

So, the next time you meet an interesting folk, as him/her, ***which member of your village do you think I should meet?***
