It’s 10:37 PM here, I’m ready for bed. I got It’s Okay To Cry by Yinka Bernie and Joyce Olong on repeat.

This is one of the nights where I want to be alone. Few of the lyric of the song describes my current state. A few hours ago, I wanted to yell - yell at someone for no reason, yell because I couldn’t process what I was feeling. I wanted to yell non-stop, then possibly cry. After which I’ll lay down and sleep.

I barely have this sort of feeling, I barely hit this level of stress. The one that makes everything to get to me, making me a ball of rumbling emotions. Emotions that I can’t process.

It’s possibly work - the workload has been on the high. Alongside other things I have going on the side….I just couldn’t feel myself no more. With all that’s happening in the world, I’m not sure how to feel, or process things. I guess I’ll just opt for breathing in and out.

I hope tonight becomes longer, longer than the one before it. I know I want to be alone, not just tonight, but tomorrow and the one after it.

If you feel the same way if you feel the need to be alone or to cry. If you feel lost inside, know that it’s okay.
